### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shubha H S, 

a datascience enthusiast from India. I enjoy solving real-world problems with data. I am currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning from Jovian(the Data Science Bootcamp with Jovian) where I completed 600+ hours of course work, 10 coding assignments and 3 projects on Web Scraping, Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

I hold a Post Graduate Certificate In Data Science and Machine Learning from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. 
I have hands on experience in solving projects of Data Science and Machine Learning.

My DataScience projects are listed below. 

Exploratory Data Analysis - Hotel Booking Demand:

Worked with Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle containing 119390 and 32 columns.
Created visualizations (Bar & Pie charts, Line charts, box plots etc.) using Seaborn, plotly & Matplotlib.
Discovered that City Hotels are more in number & cancellations are high for City Hotels than Resorts.

Scraping Yoga and Nutrition Related Articles using Python:

Scraped Yoga & Nutrition Related Articles from google search results using Requests & BeautifulSoup4.
Built functions like scrape_articles() & first_ten_pages()etc. to scrape Title, Link & Description of articles.
Stored data consisting of 194 rows x 3 columns into Yoga_nutrition_articles.csv using Pandas.

Employee Review Classification:

Worked with Employee Review data with rows 1911 to train ML models to classify Employee Reviews.
Text preprocessing using NLTK library for tokenization, stopword removal,stemming and lemmatization.
Trained 4 ML models & achieved 0.90 accuracy with Logistic Regression on test data with tuning.

Customer coupon Classification:

Worked with Customer coupon data of 10147 rows & 27 columns to classify Customer coupons.
Cleaned & analyzed & performed feature selection (18 columns) to improve ML model performance.
Trained & optimized Random Forest Classifier model with 0.76 accuracy on validation data with tuning.

IMDB Movie Reviews Classification:

Worked with IMDB dataset containing 100000 rows and 4 columns.
Text preprocessing using NLTK library for tokenization, stopword removal,stemming and lemmatization.
